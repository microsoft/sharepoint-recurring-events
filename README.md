# sp-recurring-events

The purpose of this package is to help us work with recurring events in SharePoint.  This is necessary because the SharePoint REST API endpoint does not expand events for us, but instead returns events with an XML based recurrence information.  This library takes that recurrence information and expands it to a list of events.

Ideally, eventually this project will also allow for the reverse: creating recurring events with that same recurrence structure but in an easier to use API that will convert or build the XML structure for the user.
